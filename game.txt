// this is the game file for Scraft's openIncremental game, the idea is to have a game everyone can modify and change with the right knowledge
// it is also an excuse for me to not do any schoolwork
// if you'd like to contribute you can find the manual here: http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/help.html
// just a few rules for as contributers
// 1. try to avoid spagetti-code - it is a bad example for those who are new to programming
// 2. try to respect other's decicions - you can change them but try to respect what they did, you wouldn't like someone removing that feature you worked the whole of last night on
// these rules are set in place to keep this project clean and respectfull, I'm not forcing these rules on you but they are here as guidelines to follow.

// this is the area to specify the games author and other info
let's make a game!
